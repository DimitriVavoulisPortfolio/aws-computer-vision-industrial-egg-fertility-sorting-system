# Computer Vision Industrial Egg Fertility Sorting System

## Project Overview

This project is a production-ready YOLOv8n-based Computer Vision system for egg fertility detection, designed for high-speed, single-column conveyor belt operations in industrial settings. The system provides accurate and efficient sorting of eggs into fertile and infertile categories, optimized for speed and cost-effectiveness in a highly scalable way.

### Key Features

- Pre-trained YOLOv8n model for egg fertility detection
- Optimized for high-speed conveyor belt operations
- Comprehensive testing with both individual images and batch processing
- Correction mechanism for handling multiple detections
- Designs for AWS architecture for potential future deployment
- Standarized design for implementation to per conveyor belt for high scalability
- Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mwahyuadin/dataset-of-fertile-and-infertile-chicken-eggs
