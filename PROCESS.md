# PROCESS.md - Egg Fertility Detection Development Process Documentation

## Project Overview

This document outlines the development process for our egg fertility detection system, designed for high-speed, single-column conveyor belt egg processing using AWS services. The system balances speed, cost-efficiency, and accuracy through strategic design choices and optimizations.

## Development Stages

### 1. Data Preparation and Model Training

#### Dataset Preparation
- Collected and organized 179 egg images (139 training, 40 validation) from single-column conveyor belt setups
- Created 'images' and 'labels' subdirectories for both train and validation sets
- Ensured proper labeling of fertile and infertile eggs

#### Model Training
- Chose YOLOv8n for its speed and efficiency in single-object scenarios
- Implemented and trained the model using PyTorch via Ultralytics YOLO
- Achieved high accuracy (mAP50-95: 0.995) on the validation set

### 2. AWS Deployment Design

#### Core Architecture

1. **Edge Devices**:
   - Capture images of single eggs on the conveyor belt
   - Send images to AWS for processing
   - Receive and act on results

2. **API Gateway**:
   - Provides secure API endpoint for edge devices

3. **Lambda Function**:
   - Processes images using YOLOv8n model
   - Determines egg fertility
   - Implements correction code for multiple detections

4. **S3 Buckets**:
   - Model Storage: For storing the YOLOv8n model
   - Results Storage: For storing processing results and logs

5. **CloudWatch**:
   - Monitors system performance and health

#### Data Flow
1. Edge device captures image of a single egg on the conveyor belt
2. Image is sent to API Gateway
3. API Gateway triggers Lambda function
4. Lambda function processes the image:
   - Downloads model from S3 (if not cached)
   - Performs fertility detection
   - Applies correction code for multiple detections
   - Stores results in S3
   - Returns results to API Gateway
5. Results are sent back to edge device
6. Edge device controls conveyor belt based on results
