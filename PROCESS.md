# PROCESS.md - Egg Fertility Detection Development Process Documentation

## Project Overview

This document outlines the development process for the egg fertility detection system, designed for high-speed, single-column conveyor belt egg processing using AWS services. The system balances speed, cost-efficiency, and accuracy through strategic design choices and optimizations.

## Development Stages

### 1. Data Preparation and Model Training

#### Dataset Preparation
- Collected and organized 179 egg images (139 training, 40 validation) from single-column conveyor belt setups
- Created 'images' and 'labels' subdirectories for both train and validation sets
- Ensured proper labeling of fertile and infertile eggs

#### Model Training
- Chose YOLOv8n for its speed and efficiency in single-object scenarios
- Implemented and trained the model using PyTorch via Ultralytics YOLO
- Achieved high accuracy (mAP50-95: 0.995) on the validation set

### 2. AWS Deployment Design

#### Core Architecture

1. **Edge Devices**:
   - Capture images of single eggs on the conveyor belt
   - Send images to AWS for processing
   - Receive and act on results

2. **API Gateway**:
   - Provides secure API endpoint for edge devices

3. **EC2 Instance**:
   - Processes images using YOLOv8n model
   - Determines egg fertility
   - Implements correction code for multiple detections

4. **S3 Buckets**:
   - Results Storage: For storing processing results and logs
   - Metrics Storage: For storing daily results metrics to be used later

5. **CloudWatch**:
   - Monitors system performance and health

6. **Lambda Function**:
   - Extracts the data daily after the daily production schedule
   - Makes a file with a report of the daily results to upload into the Metrics Storage S3 Bucket
   - Deletes the data in the Results Storage S3 Bucket for cost reduction
   
#### Data Flow
1. Edge device captures image of a single egg on the conveyor belt
2. Image is sent to API Gateway
3. API Gateway inputs to EC2 Instance
4. EC2 Instance processes the image:
   - Performs fertility detection
   - Applies correction code for multiple detections
   - Stores results in S3
   - Returns results to API Gateway
5. Results are sent back to edge device
6. Edge device controls conveyor belt based on results
(after production hours)
8. Lambda function is trigered:
   - Extract Results Storage S3 Bucket data
   - Make a report and dowNloads it to the Metrics Storage S3 Bucket
   - Deletes all the data in the Results Storage S3 Bucket

The implementation of correction code for multiple detections, along with the choice of a lightweight YOLOv8n model, allows for fast and accurate egg classification while minimizing computational requirements and AWS service costs. This approach demonstrates the system's suitability for real-world industrial applications, providing a robust and efficient solution for egg fertility detection.
